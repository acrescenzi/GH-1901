# Senior Checkpoint Study Guide

## What is the senior checkpoint?

A test-spec-based assessment (similar to previous checkpoints, e.g. pillars) covering: express, sequelize, react, redux, and JS algorithms. (More details [here](./senior-gateway.md).)

## What is it for?

Determining whether you are ready for what's coming in senior phase: whether you will be able to contribute meaningfully to group projects and whether you are in a place to benefit (instead of flounder) from the senior phase curriculum.

## Format

Test-spec based, like all of the previous checkpoints.

## Time frame

Unless otherwise agreed-upon, you will have three hours to complete the senior checkpoint.

## Miscellaneous study tips

- In the past, we've heard that (for many) the most difficult part of the checkpoint involved react and forms; we recommend brushing up on handling inputs in react
- Time yourself doing previous / practice checkpoints, diagnose what ends up consuming most of your time, and figure out a plan for mitigating it; *actually* timing yourself can ground you not only in whether you understand the material in general, but also whether you are ready for the pace of the senior checkpoint
- Use flash cards (and [here's a neat flash app](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)), for example for things like "how to write an express route"; effective visualization and recall of common code structure can help keep your momentum going during a checkpoint
- Identify topics you are struggling with and book office hours so we can help you get unstuck
- During the checkpoint, don't forget you can ask questions about the specs—the primary intention of the checkpoint is to determine your understanding of the material, not your ability to read test specs (that's a useful skill, not a *crucial* one at this juncture)
