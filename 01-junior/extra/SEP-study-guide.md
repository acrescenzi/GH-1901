# Senior Enrichment Project Study Guide

## What is the senior enrichment project?

A reasonably large solo project you will work on during week six of junior phase. (More details [here](./senior-gateway.md).)

## What is it for?

Determining whether you are ready for what's coming in senior phase: whether you will be able to contribute meaningfully to group projects and whether you are in a place to benefit (instead of flounder) from the senior phase curriculum.

## Format

No test specs, only descriptions of what you are supposed to build, including wireframes. All necessary details will be shared with you when you start it.

## Time frame

Roughly three and a half days, see your calendar for exact details.

## Miscellaneous study tips

- Redux (especially `react-redux` and more generally integrating redux into the frontend of an application) has historically been challenging for people during the enrichment project, so we recommend spending some quality study time on thatâ€”if you feel you are not finding good study resources, please reach out so that we can help
- Study Saturdays are a particularly good way to prepare for the senior enrichment project because the format is quite similar
- We recommend you plan to work on the project out of class, or at least leave that option open; talk to family members / roommates / whomever else about this ahead of time
- Sleep is still super important! Same with taking breaks. We encourage you to give it your all, but that means working smarter, not just harder
